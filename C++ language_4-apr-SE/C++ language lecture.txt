C++:- 
C plus one
C++ is a higher level programming language which uses classes and objects

History of C:- 
C++ was created by  Bjarne stroustrup in 1992 at bell lab. california
C with objects
C++ is an objects oriented programming language. it supports classes and objects

Interviwe Question:-
 
Difference between C and C++ ?
C++ supports classes and objects, while C does not support

Real World application of C++:-
1. Desktop application
2. GUI based application
3. Compilers
4. Banking application
5. Games 
6. Web Browsers

Syntax:- 

#- Predifined
include- To add something
iostream- i/p o/p stream- header file
using namespace std- We can use variables as name

main()
{
	code...
}


Cout- To print something on console screen

Classes and objects
Encapsulation
Constructor
Polymorphism
Function Overloading
Templates
file handling- C and C++



Class and objects:-
Class:- Class is a user  defined data type which contain data member
and member function in a single entity

data member- Variable
member function- methods
Objects:- Objects is a instance of a class or objects is a identify or class

class car

objects:- mercedez, volvo, audi
We can access the properties of class using object

Syntax:-
		class classname
		{
			Data member
			Member function
		};



Access Specifiers:-
1. Public:- We can access all properties outside the class
2. private:- We can access only inside the class

By default the class is in private mode.

method

Interviwe Question ( Difference between method and function )

Function:- Function will decliare inside the class

Method:- Method will declare inside the class

datatype methodname()


constructor: -
constructorv is  a special member fucntion which is used to contain data mamber and member function 

which is call automacticlly
there is no need to access manually
when we create object of class it will automatically call

---->there is two types of construtor:-

1. default constructor :-
 
constructor name and class namem both are same 

default constructor does not contain parameters


2. parameters constructor :- 
which is contain parameter
make sure constructor always create in public mode
we can't create constructor in privet mode


encapsulation :- 
once class contain similaer data element in a single entitiy is called encapsulation
1 setter : to set the value
2 getter : to get the value



Inheritance:- When one class inherits the properties of another class is called inheritance
Base class:- Parent class
Derived class:- Child class

Types of Inheritance:-
1. Single level Inheritance:-

		Class A
		   |
		Class B

2. Multilevel Inheritance:-

		Class A
		   |
		Class B
		   |
		Class C

3. Multiple Inheritance:-
The inheritance in which a class can be derived from more than one class can have more than one base class in known as multiple inheritance

		Base Class 1			Base Class 2
			\					/
			 \				    /
			  \				   /
				  Child Class


4. Hierarchical Inheritance:- Hierarchical Inheritance is one base class and more than one derived class

					   Class  A
					/	       \
				    / 	        \
			    Class B	    		  Class C
				/	  \			/		\
			CLass D	  Class E	  Class F   Class G


5. Hybrid Inheritance:- It is a combination of one or more inheritance.





Polymorphism:-
Polymorphism Derives from greek word. Poly means many and morphism means forms. So ployphism means many form. one class have different forms

Two types of Polymorphism:-

1. Function Overloading:- If the function having the same name but different parameters is called function overloading.
2. Function Overriding:- If derived class defines same function as defined in its base class, it is known as function overriding.





File Handling:- File Handling is a concept in which we can create, read, write and append in a file using C and C++

Modes:-
r- Read mode
w- Write mode
a- Append mode

Datatype:- FILE



Inline Function:-
The inline function function are a C++ freature to increase the execution time of a program.
Function can be instructed to compiler to make them inline so that compiler can replace those function definition wherver those are being called.

=> When a function is declared as inline, the compiler replaces the function call with the actual function code at the pointe where the function is called.



Friend function:- 
=> A friend function of class is defined outside that class but it has right to access all private and protected members of the class.


Templates in C++:-
Templates are powerful feature which allows you to write generic programs. In simple terms, you can create a single function or class that work different data types using templates. it also provides reusability
=> It is used for multiple data types.
